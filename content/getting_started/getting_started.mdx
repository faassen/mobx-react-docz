# Basic Introduction

[MobX](https://mobx.js.org) lets you create observable state. This library,
`mobx-react`, provides bindings to make React components respond to MobX
state changes.

> Frameworks such as [mobx-state-tree](https://mobx-state-tree.js.org) and
> [mobx-keystone](https://mobx-keystone.js.org/) build on
> top of MobX to offer a higher-level way to create observable models. These models
> give you additional properties, such as automatic serialization to JSON. This
> introduction uses plain MobX models. Because these advanced libraries are
> also built with MobX, the principles for React integration are the same.

## MobX models

Let's consider MobX models for animals in a zoo, where each animal
has a certain amount of energy. If the energy is below 50, the animal
is hungry. Animals can be fed to increase their energy levels:

> These code examples use TypeScript. If you use plain JavaScript you
> can skip the type declarations.

```tsx
import { observable, action, computed } from 'mobx'

class Animal {
  name: string
  species: string
  @observable energy: number

  constructor(name: string, species: string, energy: number = 100) {
    this.name = name
    this.species = species
    this.energy = energy
  }

  @action
  timePasses() {
    this.energy -= 10
  }

  @action
  feed() {
    this.energy += 50
    if (this.energy > 100) {
      this.energy = 100
    }
  }

  @computed
  get isHungry() {
    return this.energy < 50
  }
}

class Zoo {
  @observable animals: Animal[] = []

  @action
  addAnimal(animal: Animal) {
    this.animals.push(animal)
  }
}
```

## A React component that observes

We haven't used anything except plain MobX in this example. Now let's
create a React component to show information for an animal:

```tsx
import { Component } from 'react'
import { observer } from 'mobx-react'

const AnimalView = observer(({ animal }: { animal: Animal }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      {animal.name} is of species {animal.species} and is{' '}
      {animal.isHungry ? 'hungry' : 'not hungry'}.
    </div>
  )
})
```

> These examples work with `mobx-react-lite` too. `mobx-react` expands
> `mobx-react-lite` to have support for React class components. If you are
> creating a new project that only uses React function components, you can use
> `mobx-react-lite`.

Let's create an instance of `Animal`:

```tsx
const fred = new Animal('Fred', 'hippo')
```

We can now render `fred`:

```tsx
<AnimalView animal={fred} />
```

The only special thing that `AnimalView` does compared to a normal React
function component is that it is wrapped in `observer` from `mobx-react`. This
makes `AnimalView` automatically re-render itself if anything that it observes
changes. In this case the observable information is the computed property
`isHungry`, which in turn is based on the observable property `energy`.
`AnimalView` automatically re-renders itself only if `isHungry` changes. You
don't need to do anything else to make that happen.

When you wrap your React component in `observer`, it tracks any observable
property or object you access during rendering it, and reacts to any changes to
these. It won't react to any changes in observable properties you _don't_
directly or indirectly use during rendering.

## When do observers observe?

Note that MobX can only observe properties, not simple values like a `string`
or a `number`. So if you write your component to only receive simple values, it
does not benefit from observability:

```tsx
import { Component } from 'react'
import { observer } from 'mobx-react'

// Uses observer() but does not benefit from observability
const NonObservingAnimalView = observer(
  ({
    name,
    species,
    isHungry,
  }: {
    name: string
    species: string
    isHungry: boolean
  }) => {
    return (
      <div>
        {name} is of species {species} and is{' '}
        {isHungry ? 'hungry' : 'not hungry'}.
      </div>
    )
  },
)
```

The component `NonObservingAnimalView` works perfectly if it is used within
another component that receives an `Animal` instance and is also an observer,
but it re-render each and every time, because MobX cannot see whether
`name`, `species` or `isHungry` are changed. Our original `AnimalView` _does_
observe it, because it can track property accesses.

Wrapping a component in `observer` is cheap, so if you use MobX with react,
it's recommended to just wrap all your components in `observer`, even if the
component does not use any observable information yet. There is no need
distinguish between React components that observe and do not observe in this.

## Observable arrays

MobX does support observable arrays, observable
objects and observable maps, so those _can_ be observed for changes by
a React component. We demonstrate that here with `animals`:

```tsx
import { Component } from 'react'
import { observer } from 'mobx-react'

const AnimalsView = observer(({ animals }: { animals: Animal[] }) => {
  return (
    <ul>
      {animals.map(animal => (
        <ul>
          <AnimalView key={animal.name} animal={animal} />
        </ul>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
})
```

Instances of our `Zoo` class have an `animals` property that is observable, so
let's use that:

```tsx
const wilma = new Animal('Wilma', 'penguin')

const zoo = new Zoo()
zoo.addAnimal(fred)
zoo.addAnimal(wilma)
```

We can now render our animals:

```tsx
<AnimalsView animals={zoo.animals} />
```

`AnimalsView` automatically re-renders itself whenever you change the array, in
this case by using `Zoo.addAnimal`. The individual `AnimalView` re-renders
itself as before when any observed properties the underlying object change,
which in this case is its `isHungry` status.

Be aware that if you forget to wrap `AnimalsView` with `observer` it won't be
able to detect when you add (or remove) from the array, even if the parent
React component that uses `AnimalsView` is itself wrapped with `observer`. So
as mentioned previously, don't worry and just use `observer` for all your
components!

## Local component state with `useLocalStore`

So far we have discussed observable model state, where the models live outside
of the React components. It is often useful to have component-specific state as
well. Component-specific state is state that only makes sense within that React
component. It is typically very UI specific, and there is no reason to make
this state part of your application's models.

This is useful for "temporary data", such as for instance the text that a user
is currently entering into an input widget. If the user then performs a special
action such as pressing a button' this text may be saved into an actual model
instance. And depending on your application's architecture you can even manage
all your state this way.

This is the MobX equivalent of component state as you'd use with the `useState`
hook or the `setState` method in case of class components. Unlike React the
`useState` hook, the MobX local store is observable.

Just like React's `useState` you can actually pass component-specific state
down to child components or set it up as a React Context -- it doesn't
_have_ to be restricted to this component only. You could set up an entire
application using `useLocalStore` only.

Here is an example where we add an animal to a zoo using a form:

```tsx
import { Component } from 'react'
import { observer } from 'mobx-react'

const AddAnimalView = observer(({ zoo }: { zoo: Zoo }) => {
  const local = useLocalStore(() => ({
    name: '',
    species: '',
  }))

  const handleAdd = () => {
    zoo.addAnimal(new Animal(local.name, local.species))
    // clear input again after adding
    local.name = ''
    local.species = ''
  }

  const handleChangeName = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    local.name = e.target.value
  }

  const handleChangeSpecies = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    local.species = e.target.value
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        Name:
        <input type="text" value={local.name} onChange={handleChangeName} />
      </div>
      <div>
        Species:
        <input
          type="text"
          value={local.species}
          onChange={handleChangeSpecies}
        />
      </div>
      <button onClick={handleAdd}>Add animal</button>
    </div>
  )
})
```

Here we define an object called `local` with two observable properties, `name`
and `species`. We use the React [controlled
components](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components)
technique to allow the user to edit these properties. As you can see, this
simply involves mutating the local state directly. We also have an `Add animal`
button which uses the local state to modify the zoo using the `addAnimal`
action. It then needs to reset the local state again to allow the user to
enter another animal.

XXX interaction with strict mode, see https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-react-lite/issues/235
if strict mode is the recommended story, what would we recommend instead of
use useLocalStore?

## Application organization

In these examples we described how you can create observer React components
that take observable instances as props, and this is a good pattern to follow.

But where do you get these props from? Often they can be retrieved from
_other_ observable objects. Let's consider `ZooView`:

```tsx
import { Component } from 'react'
import { observer } from 'mobx-react'

const ZooView = observer(({ zoo }: { zoo: Zoo }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <AnimalsView animals={zoo.animals} />
      <AddAnimalView zoo={zoo} />
    </div>
  )
})
```

Where does `AnimalsView` get its `animals` prop from? From the `zoo` in
`ZooView`. Where does `AnimalView` get its `animal` prop? From the each animal
in the `AnimalsView`. We also pass `zoo` into `AddAnimalView` directly.

We recommend using props to pass instances around to the React components that
need them. It ensures your components are loosely-coupled, and it makes it
easier to write an automated test for them.

But it has to start somewhere. Where would we put `zoo`? One simple approach is
to make it a global in your application, and simply import it when you need it
at the top of your React application. Frameworks like `mobx-state-tree` and
`mobx-keystone` offer more sophisticated patterns to maintain such a root
store.
